# Project Introduction

## Overview

### Project Information

The number of academic institutions still use manual processes to store and transfer academic records like transcripts and certifications between institutions and to potential organizations, despite the fact that many large institutions are now adopting the modern practice of maintaining electronic academic records.The process can take up to several days, just for students who want to review their own transcripts, so a common transfer for a student can take anywhere from a few weeks to a month. Due to the time required to process and submit appeal requests using the widely used paper method, more serious errors could happen and the process could take several months. In addition to the significant wait time and the possibility of physical damage or loss of records during storage and transportation, there is also the risk of credential tampering by fraudulent parties. The cost of processing time, manual work effort, postage, and transit fees, as well as the storage and shipping of physical records, are also very expensive.

The emerging solutions are primarily based on email-based solutions or the transfer of PDF files while remaining limited by nationality, privacy and security barriers. Although the popularity of cryptocurrencies and NFTs has led to the implementation of Blockchain as a host of applications in the financial sector, the field is more diverse in both technical and application areas [1]. As distributed applications are increasingly applied in various fields such as data storage (including handling medical records and healthcare [2,5]), Cloud and Grid Computing [3], e-vote [4] , Service for IoT [6], Banking system[7] and foremost is the field of Education. Academic institutions can benefit from blockchain technology to provide a decentralized and immutable ledger to confirm the integrity of academic records [10]. Then, solutions for storing and anti-fraud of online electronic degrees have also been conceived to bring the initial benefits of applying Blockchain technology [8][9]. While these solutions provide a more modern approach to the storage and the transfer of academic records, there are still limitations in terms of widespread adoption, auditability, and scalability. A successful solution for storing and exchanging electronic school records will include Security and Privacy, Scalability and at the same time benefit from the advantages of blockchain technology as Distributed, Transparency further described.

The goal of our proposed system is to address the limitations of existing solutions by utilizing Blockchain technology to provide a secure, verifiable, and tamper-proof method of storing, accessing, managing, and exchanging electronic school records between institutions.

## Background

In terms of digital solutions, in recent years, there have been technologies to manage and store academic records digitally. The biggest disadvantage of the above solutions is the centralization of data, so it will have a big impact if the system crashes, leading to data loss, in addition to the reliability of the data when it is stored by a third party.

One of the achievements of the online storage industry is the invention of Blockchain. This is a form of distributed database in which data is stored in a block and connects the blocks in a chain by hashing mechanism [11]. If we consider the solution of digitizing academic records alone, Blockchain has the following advantages [12]:

Decentralized: Data is preserved in many member machines participating in the network. When data is lost, it can be restored from member computers.

Transparency: The hashing mechanism makes the data in one block verified by other blocks, making the data immutable. Therefore, the data on the Blockchain network is verified, indestructible, and cannot be faked, so it has clarity, transparency, and can be trusted.

No third party interference: Data is verified and stored by network members, different from traditional solutions when having to depend on a trusted third party as a storage place.

For transactions to take place on the Blockchain network, we have a Smart Contract mechanism. This is a pre-programmed set of rules to regulate the conditions and order of execution of a transaction on the Blockchain network, signed by the parties involved, verified by the members of the network, and without interference of third parties. It is used to process data on the network, and also set conditions that limit the execution of operations on data on the network. It is a self-run program on the Blockchain network so it is transparent [13].

Another important feature of a record management system is the privacy of students’ personal information, which forces systems to have an authorization feature so that only authorized persons can view student information on transcripts. With Blockchain, there are a number of open source projects to implement the above properties. One of them is Hyperledger Fabric. This is an open-source project from the Hyperledger series about private and permissioned Blockchain. [14]. Unlike public Blockchains like Bitcoin or Etherium, where anyone can participate and make transactions, Fabric network members are registered for attention from a Member Service Provider. The Smart Contract mechanism is extensible to limit the access and data processing rights of members registered in the network. An example of applying Hyperledger Fabric in education storage can be said to be Sony Global Education when they choose to implement a cetification archiving system, which can limit data access for stakeholders [15]. For a solution to digitalize records, we can post a student’s personal information and transcripts online and limit access to and edit records to only the school where the student resides. We can also create a feature that only exports grades from records stored on the network for statistics and analysis.

## Existing Systems

Many high schools in Viet Nam use one of existing online systems to store students’ academic records and notify their parents about recent records, but they still use traditional record papers for post-graduation & university / college enrollment. Therefore, The teachers find it difficult to update their students’ records because they have to update the records on both the online system & the record paper. Moreover, the online system is a centralized system that only the admins and the teachers can see and interact, so there is little transparency for students who want to see their records at any time.
